# 🚀 Lecture 4 – Connections, Requests & Feed Actions (Gittogether)

In this lecture, we start building the **core social feature** of Gittogether —  
developer connections, similar to LinkedIn / Tinder-style interactions.

The focus is on:
- Sending connection requests
- Viewing connections
- Handling requests
- Aligning frontend strictly with backend APIs
- Managing connection-related state properly

---

## 🎯 Goal of Lecture 4

- Build “Interested” functionality
- Allow users to send connection requests
- Create a page to view all connections
- Create a page to view incoming requests
- Introduce connection-specific global state
- Fix API mismatches between frontend and backend

---

## ❤️ Interested → Connection Request

Feature requirement:
> Jab user “Interested” pe click kare,  
> toh saamne wale user ko **connection request** jaani chahiye.

How this works:
- Feed shows user cards
- Each card has an “Interested” action
- On click:
  - Frontend triggers backend API
  - Backend creates a connection request
  - Frontend updates UI accordingly

Frontend **does not decide** connection logic.  
It strictly follows backend rules.

---

## 🔗 Backend-Driven Development

All frontend work in this lecture is done by:
- Referring backend APIs
- Matching request payloads
- Matching response structures
- Respecting backend enums and statuses

No assumptions are made on frontend.

This ensures:
- No mismatches
- No broken flows
- Production-grade integration

---

## 👥 Viewing Connections

New requirement:
> User apne **connections** dekh paaye

For this:
- A dedicated **Connections page** is created
- Backend API is used to fetch:
  - Accepted connections only
- Frontend simply renders the list

This page represents **real professional relationships**.

---

## 🧩 Introducing Connection Slice

As connection data is needed across:
- Feed
- Connections page
- Requests page

A new Redux slice is introduced:
- `connectionSlice`

---

## ⚙️ Working of Connection Slice

Connection slice responsibilities:
- Store accepted connections
- Store pending requests
- Update state after actions
- Act as a single source of truth for connections

Why needed:
- Avoid prop drilling
- Keep logic centralized
- Make UI reactive to backend changes

Connection slice behaves like a **domain-specific cache**.

---

## 📄 Connection Page

Connection page is built to:
- Show all accepted connections
- Display user cards
- Consume data from connection slice

Key idea:
> Connection page only **reads state**,  
> it does not manage business logic.

---

## 📨 Creating Connection Request Page

Next feature:
> User ko jo connection requests aaye hain,  
> wo dekh paana chahiye.

For this:
- A **Requests page** is created
- Backend API for pending requests is used
- Requests are displayed clearly

Each request represents a **decision point**.

---

## 🔄 Making Request Page Functional

Request page handles:
- Incoming requests
- Different request states
- UI rendering based on backend response

Frontend does NOT:
- Change request status arbitrarily
- Hardcode logic

Everything flows from backend.

---

## 🔧 Fixing API Mismatches

Important learning in this lecture:

Earlier:
- Frontend API calls were mismatched
- Payloads didn’t match backend expectations
- Endpoints were inconsistent

Fix:
- Carefully re-read backend APIs
- Align frontend requests exactly
- Match route names, params, and data formats

Result:
- Clean integration
- No silent failures
- Predictable behavior

---

## 🧠 Backend Thinking Applied to Frontend

- Feed → Trigger layer
- Connection slice → Domain state
- Backend → Business authority
- Requests → Stateful workflow
- Frontend → Renderer + dispatcher

Frontend never becomes the decision-maker.

---

## 🔥 Interview-Level Explanation

> “Connection logic is backend-driven.  
Frontend triggers actions, updates global state via Redux slices, and renders UI based on backend responses.”

This shows **real-world system design thinking**.

---

## ✅ Lecture 4 Summary

- Built Interested → Connection request feature
- Followed backend APIs strictly
- Created Connections page
- Introduced connectionSlice
- Understood working of connection slice
- Built Requests page
- Fixed frontend-backend API mismatches
- Strengthened backend-driven frontend approach

---
Gittogether frontend is now **feature-rich, structured, and scalable**.
