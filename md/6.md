# 🚀 Launching AWS EC2 Instance & Deploying Backend – Revision Notes

---

## 🌩️ What is AWS?

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a cloud computing platform that provides servers, storage, databases, networking, and many other services over the internet.

Instead of buying physical machines, we rent servers online and pay only for what we use.

## ☁️ What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing means:
- Using remote servers (data centers)
- Accessing them via the internet
- No need to manage physical hardware

Used for:
- Hosting websites
- Running backend servers
- Storing images and data

---

## 🧾 Step 1: Create AWS Account

- Signed up on AWS
- Added debit/credit card
- ₹2 deducted for card verification (temporary)
- AWS Free Tier activated

---

## 🖥️ Step 2: Launch EC2 Instance

### What is EC2?
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a virtual machine (server) provided by AWS.

### Configuration Used
- Service: EC2
- AMI (OS): Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Instance Type: t3.micro (Free Tier eligible)
- Region: us-east-1
- Storage: Default (~8 GB)
- Network: Default VPC

## 🔑 Step 3: Key Pair (Very Important)

When creating a server, we need a secure way to access it.

- AWS provides a `.pem` file
- `.pem` file is the private key of the server
- It acts like a password for SSH access
- Without it, the server cannot be accessed

Rule:
- Never share the `.pem` file
- Never upload it to GitHub

Downloaded key:

Git-together-secret.pem

## 🧠 Why `.pem` File is Needed

- Jab hum machine create karte hain, hume ek secure tareeka chahiye hota hai access karne ka
- AWS uses SSH with key-based authentication
- `.pem` file proves we are the owner of the server

---

## 🪟 Step 4: Fix `.pem` Permissions (Windows)

Windows Command Prompt / PowerShell does not support `chmod`, so Git Bash is used.

Command:
```bash
chmod 400 Git-together-secret.pem


cd $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads
ssh -i Git-together-secret.pem ubuntu@52.90.108.147


✅ Step 6: Successful Login Confirmation

When this appears:

ubuntu@ip-172-31-20-244:~$


It means:

SSH connection is successful

We are inside AWS EC2

Linux server is ready

🔄 Step 7: Update the Server

Inside EC2 terminal:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y


This:

Updates system packages

Applies security patches

🔁 Step 8: Reboot the Server

After updates, Ubuntu suggests reboot to load the new kernel.

Command:

sudo reboot


What happens:

SSH connection closes (normal)

EC2 instance restarts safely

🔌 Step 9: Reconnect After Reboot

After waiting ~1 minute:

ssh -i Git-together-secret.pem ubuntu@52.90.108.147


Again seeing:

ubuntu@ip-172-31-20-244:~$


Confirms:

Server reboot successful

System fully ready

🧠 Important Points (Interview Ready)

EC2 is a virtual Linux server

.pem file is mandatory for SSH access

SSH username depends on the AMI

Closing terminal does NOT stop EC2

Rebooting EC2 does NOT delete data
