## 3️⃣ Validation (Tricky but Clean Way 😉)

Validation is handled in a **centralized and reusable way**.

### 🔹 Centralized Validation File

### Signup Validation Rules

- All fields are required

### Login Validation Rules

- Email is required
- Password is required

### Validation Pattern
- Validation functions return **true / false**
- Error messages are handled via `setError`
- UI clearly shows validation feedback

This keeps components **clean and readable**.

### Buttons added:

Frontend behaves like a **well-disciplined client**.
